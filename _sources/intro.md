# An Introduction to Bayesian Filtering: Theory and Methods

## Opening Tutorial at Summer School on Bayesian Filtering 2024

This is a companion webpage to the introduction course on Bayesian filtering at the [Summer School on Bayesian Filtering (SSBF) 2024](https://www.icms.org.uk/SSBF2024). The course is taught by [O. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me).

We will try to be self-contained within this lecture, but some useful material is previous [SMC Masterclass lecture notes](https://akyildiz.me/works/smc_masterclass.pdf), resources for my LTCC course on [Advanced Computational Methods in Statistics](https://akyildiz.me/advanced-computational-statistics/intro.html) and resources (and notes) of my [Stochastic Simulation](https://akyildiz.me/stochastic-simulation) course.
