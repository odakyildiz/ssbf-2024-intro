# Coursework

## Coursework option 1: particle methods

1- Pick a SSM of your choice so that it is possible the state and observation to be multidimensional with dimensions $d_x$ and $d_y$ respectively.

2- Using some known values for the static parameters implement the bootstrap particle filter

3-  generate plots and tables for varying $N$, $d_x$ and $d_y$.

4- assess BPF based on accuracy (wrt true states) & variance of normalising constant and integrals like posterior (filter) mean.

5- Consider a parameter estimation method of your choice (particle MCMC, gradients, nested PF...)

6- implement it and describe results for varying $N$ (and $M$ in the nested PF case), $d_x$ and $d_y$ using plots and tables.

7- In your answers provide also short comments

## Coursework option 2:

If your research is related to computational statistics, or uses MCMC:

1- present your model of interest and problem at hand

2- the inferential method for problem (e.g. Bayesian inference, optimisation etc.) and the challenges involved,

3- simulation method (e.g. MCMC, IS, SMC),

4- numerical results

5- a discussion on how material in this course can be used for extensions
